# DBMS Master Guide: Brain-Friendly Learning

![DBMS Master Guide Cover](./cover.png)

Welcome to the **DBMS Master Guide**. This book is designed differently. Instead of dry theory, we use **Neurological Anchors**—analogies, visualizations, and mental models—to help you truly understand and remember Database Management Systems.

## 🧠 how to Use This Book

Each module starts with a **Neurological Anchor**. This is your mental hook. Hang every new concept onto this hook.
